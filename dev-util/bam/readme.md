# BAM (Build System)

Bam is a fast and flexible build system. Bam uses Lua to describe the build process. It's takes its inspiration for the script files from scons. While scons focuses on being 100% correct when building, bam makes a few sacrifices to acquire fast full and incremental build times. http://matricks.github.io/bam/

Version bump on demand -> file new issue or rename the `SOURCE` on your desired version.

If you encounter issues -> file new issue i do my best to fix it.
